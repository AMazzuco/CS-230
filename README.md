Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted to bring their Android game Draw It or Lose It to other platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 I think I did a good job of explaining different options the client had in a clear way.
 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Filling out the design document helped me not get overwhelmed with all the code that needed to be added and helped me keep it more organized as I worked through it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I might revise the first few sections just because it has been a minute since I wrote that section and I may be able to improve the clarity of some of it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the user’s needs for multiplatform functionality and was able to provide a recommendation of a server based on it. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because it is way easier to fix something needed in the design phase than it is later into the lifecycle of a program.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The design document helped me organize all of the changes that needed to be made in the code based on how they interacted with other files. The UML chart was very helpful and definitely something I would like to use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application as organization is very helpful in breaking down larger projects into more manageable parts.
